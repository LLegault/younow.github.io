YouNow is committed to maintaining a safe, inclusive community. The following standards have been established toward that end and are applicable to all YouNow users. Violation of these standards may result in account suspension or a permanent ban. 

## Violent behavior and/or self-harm is not permitted

Safety is YouNow's top priority, and we take threats of violence and self-harm very seriously. We may ban users whose content breaches these terms and may also report it to law enforcement if we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm or a direct threat to public safety. Similarly, we prohibit threats. We encourage any user considering self-harm to seek help. The 24-hour National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-8255.

## Nudity and/or sexually explicit behavior is not permitted

- Users of all genders under the age of 18 must be fully clothed on camera. Any user under the age of 18 without a shirt may be subject to a suspension or permanent ban. Users of all ages may not expose genitalia in any way.
- Encouragement of nudity is prohibited on YouNow. 
- Users are not allowed to:
  - Use vulgar, profane, or sexually explicit language on camera or in the chat.
  - Display offensive or sexually explicit images on camera.
  - Perform sexual or sexually suggestive acts, show sex toys onscreen, or dance in a sexually suggestive manner.

## Bullying, harassment, or hate speech is not permitted

Though we encourage YouNow users to express themselves freely, respect for community members is paramount. Users who taunt, bully, use hate speech, or engage in any other form of harassment risk being suspended or permanently banned. Be nice to each other!

## Illegal substance use is not permitted onscreen

Onscreen drug consumption and drug paraphernalia is prohibited, as is the consumption of alcohol by users under the age of 21.

## You must be at least 13 years old to use YouNow

YouNow is intended for individuals ages 13 and older. If we become aware of an account that belongs to an individual under 13, that account will be terminated. Users who are older than 13 may have guests on camera who are under 13, but underage guests may not appear alone on broadcast.

## Revealing private contact information is not permitted

Revealing an individual's personal information, including email addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses, is forbidden. We also strongly recommend that you keep your personal information private.

## Prank calls to emergency authorities or hotlines is not permitted

YouNow does not permit prank calls to emergency authorities or emergency hotlines, and any user who in engages in such will be subject to a permanent ban.

## Solicitation or encouragement of rule-breaking is not permitted

- Solicitation of sexual or illegal acts is forbidden. Similarly, it is forbidden for users to request sexual images or personal information from other users. 
- Engagement in illegal or inappropriate commercial activities or sales is also strictly forbidden. Such activities include but are not limited to: pyramid schemes, multi-level marketing offers, and homegrown sweepstakes.
- It is forbidden to encourage the violation of community standards either in chat or while broadcasting.


## Spam is not permitted

It is forbidden to interrupt the flow of chat sessions with the use of repetitive typing or activity that makes it difficult for users to maintain a conversation, as is the posting of links to pornographic or malicious sites.

## Impersonation is not permitted

It is forbidden to change your chat name or create a new account in order to impersonate a YouNow user. Claiming to be another person or creating a false presence for an organization undermines the community and violates YouNow's Terms of Use (/policy/en/terms). Additionally, the creation and use of multiple accounts must abide by YouNow's Terms of Use (/policy/en/terms). Any abuse or inappropriate use of one account may result in permanent termination of all accounts.

## No copyright infringement

YouNow is committed to protecting the rights of copyright holders and seeks to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of intellectual property. Unauthorized copying, distribution, modification, public display, or public performance of copyrighted works is a copyright infringement, and YouNow will undertake appropriate steps against repeat copyright offenders. Re-broadcasting other users’ content without written permission is considered copyright infringement and is therefore prohibited.

Please be advised that in applicable situations, YouNow reserves the right to report suspicious and/or criminal activity to local authorities.
