## Following & Understanding YouNow Partner Guidelines.

As a member of the Partner Program on YouNow, you serve as an example to other YouNowers, who look to you as a representative of the YouNow service. 

The YouNow community is inspired by your words and deeds. As such, YouNow partnership comes not only with benefits, but also with responsibility–a responsibility to serve as an example to our users and uphold the [Partner Guidelines](policy/en/partners).

Please note that YouNow reserves the right to suspend or remove any account at any time for conduct that we determine to be inappropriate or harmful to the YouNow community. **Violations of these rules & guidelines may result in warnings, suspensions or permanent removal of your account and your partnership.**

As a partner, we expect you to uphold all of YouNow's [Community Guidelines] (policy/en/rules), [Partner Guidelines](policy/en/partners), and [Terms of Servce](policy/en/terms) during your broadcasts, and to encourage a safe and positive experience for the entire YouNow community! 

## Ensuring Account Security & Privacy.

- **Keep your personal information safe.** Please **never share your personal information with others** on YouNow or outside of YouNow. Personal information includes your personal address, phone numbers, location, information about your family members and friends, etc. 

- **Keep your passwords safe.** YouNow or YouNow staff will **never** contact you asking for your password, login credentials on YouNow, or your bank information except for the Tipalti iFrame portal which **only you have** direct access to,  from your YouNow account. Please block any number or email address that may contact you for any personal information and report the email to us at partnersupport@younow.com if you receive any suspicious emails.
