4. Can any YouNow broadcaster receive the six bar-based gifts?
 * There are six gifts that users can buy with bars 
 * All YouNow broadcasters can receive 50 Likes, Fan Mail, a Marriage Proposal, Applause, or 400 Likes. However, only Partners receive bars from the blue tip jar. Additionally, only Partners earn revenue when receiving these six bar-based gifts. 

5. How much do I earn from the gifts?
 * At the end of your broadcast, a screen will pop up outlining your estimated earnings. Your total earnings will depend on the number of gifts you’ve received throughout your broadcast. Therefore, the more you engage with your viewers, the more you earn. 
 
6. What is Fan Mail and how does it work?
 * Viewers can send you Fan Mail during your broadcast. It is an opportunity for them to send you a personalized note that is displayed across the live chat for everyone to see. This is a chance for your fans to really get your attention. As a broadcaster, you have to “accept” the Fan Mail when you receive it so that it will be displayed during the broadcast. You only earn from this gift when you accept it. It is recommended that you acknowledge Fan Mail aloud during your broadcast, as this will encourage further engagement from your fans.

7. What determines my five Top Fans?
 * During every broadcast, there is a list of your Top Fans. These are viewers who’ve given you the highest amount of bar-based gifts during that specific broadcast. Next to these names, there is an indication of how many bars you’ve received from them.  

8. Where can I find my Top Fans?
 * During a broadcast, the Top Fans are displayed right above the chat. Scroll to the right to see all top five.
 * When your top fans are interacting in the chat, their names will pop up with a small crown icon; this way, you can easily recognize your biggest supporters during the broadcast.

9. How do I see my overall Top Fans — not just for a specific broadcast?
 * To find the list of your overall Top Fans, go to your profile page, and you’ll see the full list on the bottom right-hand side; these fans also have a crown image next to their name when they type in the chat.  Click [*here*](http://blog.younow.com/post/117267922019/what-does-the-crown-symbol-mean) for more information.

10. How can I trend as a broadcaster?
 * Broadcasters trend by a combination of factors including:
    
   a. Total broadcast “likes”
    
    b. How quickly “likes” accumulate
    
    c. Broadcast activity (e.g., chat, gifts received, etc.)
    
    d. Viewers
    
    e. Broadcast length

11. How do I receive more bar-based gifts and Likes from my viewers during a broadcast?
 * We don’t recommend explicitly asking your viewers for Likes and bar-based gifts, but here are some tips to encourage gifting and liking:  
  
   a. In order to receive more Likes, offer an incentive, for example: “When we get to 1,000 Likes, I’ll tell you a story!”
  
    b. Any time you receive a bar-based gift, thank your fans and/or give them a shout-out. Ultimately, your viewers are looking for your attention and want to show the love, so the more you acknowledge them, the more they’ll want to support you.   

12. What hashtag should I use when I broadcast?
 * Try to use trending hashtags that are relevant to your content (e.g., #dance, #musicians). You can only use one hashtag during a specific broadcast. 


14. How can I gain more viewers?
 * Here are some tips:
  
   a. Add your YouNow link to your social media profiles (e.g., on your YouTube banner and “About” page).. (Click [*here*](http://blog.younow.com/post/117795296724/how-to-get-more-viewers-fans-on-younow) to see how.)
  
    b. Inform your fanbase you’re going live — hit ‘em up on YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Vine and Snapchat!
  
    c. Ask your viewers to click the “share” icon during your broadcast. 

15. How long should I broadcast?
 * Many partners broadcast between 30 and 60 minutes, as it takes time to build momentum. Of course, feel free broadcast for as long as you’d like. 

16. When is a good time to go live?
 * Experiment with different times and ask your fans when is best for them. Be mindful of different timezones. The most popular times are weekends and evenings.

#### Payment

19. How do I know how much money I’ve earned per broadcast?
 * You’ll receive an estimated summary of how much you’ve earned at the end of each broadcast.

20. How can I get paid? 
 * Click on "Payment Settings" and input your payment details directly on the YouNow website (this is not available via mobile). This link is shown above "Profile".
 * All partners need to earn at least $75 a month to receive payment. If you have not met the $75 threshold, your earnings will be rolled over to the following month. 

21. When do I get paid and how often?
 * You’ll be paid once a month at the beginning of every month, if you’ve earned at least $75. You’ll receive an email with your earnings listed from the previous month. For example: In the beginning of February, you’ll receive your earning summary for January. 
 * Payment is sent during the first 5 to 10 business days of the month. 


23. How can I receive a summary of my earnings?
 * At the beginning of every month, you will receive an email summary of your earnings from the previous month. The total amount listed on your earnings page is estimated.

24. Why is my monthly total payment not the same as the total amount on my earnings page?
 * The earnings shown on your YouNow page is an estimate. Apple/Google takes a small percentage of your earnings from the bar-based gifts. 

25. I’ve been paid, but I still have an outstanding balance on my “earnings” page. Why?
 * If you’ve been paid for your previous month’s earnings, the money displayed on your “earnings” page is most likely your revenue from the current month.  
 * Here’s an example: Let's say we paid you on February 6th for your January earnings, but you still have $100 displayed on your “earnings” page. That’s because you likely broadcasted at the beginning of February and you earned $100 from February 1st through February 6th. 

26. I still have a question about my payment. Who can I contact?
 * Of course! If you have any payment questions, please send an email to [partnerpayments@younow.com](mailto:partnerpayments@younow.com). 

27. If I am getting paid via PayPal, wire transfer or ACH, are there any fees?
 * When you input your payment details via the "Payment Settings" on the YouNow web page, all of the fees are explained.

31. How do I change my preferred method of payment?
 * At any time, you can click on "Payment Settings" and update your payment method and/or details.

32. How do I receive a 1099 tax form from YouNow so I can file my taxes?
 * If you receive payments via PayPal, you can access information about 1099s [*here*](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/irs6050w). 
 * If you receive payment via wire transfer or ACH, YouNow will send you a 1099 at the beginning of the year - but only if you've earned at least $600 the previous year. 

33. Are taxes withheld when I receive my YouNow Partner payment?
 * Taxes are not withheld. Depending on your level of income, you may or may not have to pay these taxes back. Please adjust your funds and savings accordingly.
