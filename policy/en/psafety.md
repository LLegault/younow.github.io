## Welcome to YouNow Partner Program!

Congratulations on being selected as a YouNow partner, once again! To ensure that you have the best experience possible on YouNow, please familiarize yourself with YouNow's [Partner Guidelines](policy/en/partners), [Community Guidelines](policy/en/rules), and YouNow’s [Trust & Safety](policy/en/trust), in addition to other safety recommendations listed in this Partner Safety Package. 

The following information will help you have the safest possible experience on YouNow. Please read and remember that your safety is our number one priority. 

## Following & Understanding YouNow Partner Guidelines.

As a member of the Partner Program on YouNow, you serve as an example to other YouNowers, who look to you as a representative of the YouNow service. 

The YouNow community is inspired by your words and deeds. As such, YouNow partnership comes not only with benefits, but also with responsibility–a responsibility to serve as an example to our users and uphold the [Partner Guidelines](policy/en/partners).

Please note that YouNow reserves the right to suspend or remove any account at any time for conduct that we determine to be inappropriate or harmful to the YouNow community. **Violations of these rules & guidelines may result in warnings, suspensions or permanent removal of your account and your partnership.**

As a partner, we expect you to uphold all of YouNow's [Community Guidelines](policy/en/rules), [Partner Guidelines](policy/en/partners), and [Terms of Service](policy/en/terms) during your broadcasts, and to encourage a safe and positive experience for the entire YouNow community! 

## Ensuring Account Security & Privacy.
	
We take our partners’ account security seriously. We put together the following tips & tricks for you, to help you keep your account on YouNow safe and secure.

- **Keep your personal information safe.** Please **never share your personal information with others** on YouNow or outside of YouNow. Personal information includes your personal address, phone numbers, location, information about your family members and friends, etc. 

- **Keep your passwords safe.** YouNow or YouNow staff will **never** contact you asking for your password, login credentials on YouNow, or your bank information except for the Tipalti iFrame portal which **only you have** direct access to,  from your YouNow account. Please block any number or email address that may contact you for any personal information and report the email to us at partnersupport@younow.com if you receive any suspicious emails.

## YouNow’s Safety Tools.

YouNow uses a combination of automated systems, manual monitoring, and self-service tools for partners to maintain a safe community on YouNow. Guided by our Community Standards & Rules and Terms of Service, we continuously review YouNow broadcasts to warn, suspend, or ban any users who violate our policies.

Self-Service Safety Tools: Please review the Self-Service Safety Tools attached below on Page 4* displaying the tools you can use during your broadcasts. These include: 

- **My Referee** — Assign your own referee to your broadcast chats to help keep offensive users or trolls out of sight.
- **Blocking low level chat** — Block users who are below level 10 or level 5 from your broadcast chat to help keep spammers or trolls away. 
- **Blocking users**  — Block any user from  posting on your profile or interacting in your broadcasts. Click or tap on the user’s name, click or tap the red flag icon in his or her mini-profile, and select the “block” option.
- **Live flagging & reporting options** — Help us keep YouNow safe! All users should flag content they believe violates YouNow's policies or puts any member of the community at risk. When you flag a user, the flag goes to live moderators who will review the situation and take action immediately as they see fit. Please only flag content that you deem inappropriate! Repetitive false flagging could result in a short suspension.
