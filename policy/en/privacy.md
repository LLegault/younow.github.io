**Last updated: May 23, 2018**

YouNow (“Company”, “we” or “our”) is committed to safeguarding any personal data that may be collected through our website (the "Website") and mobile application (the "App") and together, the "Services". We want you to understand how your personal data will be used and shared. The following policy describes our personal data handling practices.

## **WHO WE ARE AND GETTING IN TOUCH**
YouNow, Inc.’s head office is located at 245 5th Avenue New York, NY 10016, USA. Any questions or inquiries relating to privacy or data protection should be directed to our Data Protection Officer at [privacy@younow.com](mailto:privacy@younow.com). EU residents may also exercise their data subject rights such as the right of access or erasure by contacting our Data Protection Officer.

## **PRIVACY COMPLIANCE**
The personal data we collect may be transferred to, stored at and processed by us and our affiliated third parties outside of the country in which you reside, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. However, YouNow makes reasonable efforts to respect the privacy rights of all of its users. For example, we have taken important steps for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR) for EU users.

As a data controller, YouNow understands our obligations under the GDPR (EU) 2016/679 and has thus taken the following steps:

-	Revised this Privacy Policy to provide you with a clear understanding of our privacy practices; 
-	Appointed a YouNow Data Protection Officer and EU Representative who can respond to EU data subjects and Data Protection Authorities as needed;
-	Introduced new product features and functionality to allow users better control over their privacy;
-	Reviewed our data inventory and third party relationships to gain a complete picture of data flows and take a Privacy by Design approach to our data holdings;
-	Enhanced our data security controls such that regardless of the data flow, reasonable efforts are made to protect our user data at all times; 
-	Developed a procedure to respond to any requests that may be received from users who are EU residents regarding their data subject rights (available May 25, 2018); 
-	Reviewed and revised our data retention rules to ensure YouNow is not retaining personal data that is no longer in use;
-	Required our third parties who we entrust with YouNow user data to commit to the continued protection of such data and comply with their GDPR responsibilities as a data processor; and  
-	Instituted a privacy data breach response plan to ensure any privacy incidents are handled effectively and efficiently.

## **PERSONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT**
Our primary purpose in collecting your personal data is to optimize and enhance your YouNow experience. We use social sign-in to collect certain personal data from the social media platforms you use in order to register you on YouNow. We also collect user generated content such as your broadcasts, chats, posts or other contributions. Please do not share highly sensitive personal data using our Services. Some information about your use of our Services is collected automatically,  such as when you went live and how many fans you have.

As used in this Privacy Policy, **“Personal Data”** is as defined in the GDPR as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person **(“data subject”)**. There are a number of different collections of personal data from you:

**DIRECT COLLECTION:**

**Registration:** When you register to use our Services, we receive certain information about you through Facebook®, Twitter®, Google+®, or Instagram®, as applicable to your method of registration. This information may include your name, your location and language, a profile picture, your e-mail and mailing address, your phone number and social following. The registration process is optional for YouNow users who only wish to view content, but is required for users who would like to broadcast via YouNow or to use the Services’ more advance options. You can update your profile data at any time.

**YouNow Activity:** Any user generated content is collected by YouNow, such as when you enter  profile data, create broadcasts, chats, posts, moments, when you gift or fan another user or subscribe to a partner’s broadcasts.
Communication from You: When you contact us with questions, concerns or for purposes of customer/technical support, we collect the information contained in your message, which may include your name, contact details and any other personal data you provide.

**Via Surveys:** We may collect your user information through surveys we conduct from time to time with respect to our Service. Participation in and providing information through such surveys is optional.

**AUTOMATIC COLLECTION:**

**Social Network Data:** Your social following, that is, data about your connections, will also be collected by YouNow, and if these connections are YouNow users, they will automatically appear as your fans. Keep in mind that we receive information from other users’ registrations for our Services, which may include your social username.

**Metadata:** Information collected behind the scenes by YouNow’s servers about your use of YouNow’s Services. This includes, but is not limited to, when you last logged in, when you created a broadcast, liked or commented on someone else’s broadcast, when you created a moment, how many bars or coins you have, your total airtime, your IP address and information about your device or browser.

Automated data collection does not lead to profiling that significantly affects YouNow users, but simply gives YouNow a clear picture of its users and influencers. For a complete listing of data fields collected and used by YouNow, you may contact us at privacy@younow.com

**DO NOT PROVIDE SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA:**
We ask that you not send us, and you do not disclose, through a broadcast or other interaction, “special categories of personal data” as defined in the GDPR (information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or physiological beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership or data concerning data subject’s sex life or sexual orientation). 

For YouNow users who are EU residents, should you provide “special categories of personal data” using our Services, you understand that you have expressly consented to the collection, use and disclosure of such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## **WHAT’S PUBLIC AND WHAT’S NOT?**
Information you voluntarily transmit via our Services is publicly accessible and may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We do not control such uses of your personally identifiable information, and by using our Services, you assume the risk and acknowledge that the personal data provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties and by us for any number of purposes.

Your user profile and most of the content you create when using our Services, such as your broadcasts, moments, chats, posts, as well as your fanning and gifting activity is publicly displayed to other YouNow users. Through your Privacy Settings, you can choose to hide your location and the number of fans you have. Most of the data that YouNow collects about your YouNow activity (“metadata”) is not publicly available.
W
hen you stream live video content or interact with the video streams in real time, this data is available to other YouNow users in real time. Some metadata, such as number of likes or views, may also be published, however, most of the metadata that YouNow collects is not publicly available.

## **HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA**
YouNow uses personal data responsibly in order to ensure we are meeting your expectations of our Services, responding to you when you contact us and providing a safe space for YouNow users.

We may use the personal data provided to us to:
•	Contact you from time to time with critical information about service updates, technical issues or other information important for our Services, or to provide you with the support you are requesting, for example, if clarification is needed when you report another YouNow user;
•	Receive feedback from you and inquire about any features you would like to see in future products. We may also message you through the App to promote new products or services that you may be interested in (or contact you by e-mail with your explicit consent);
•	Customize, measure and improve our Services and content;
•	Analyze our user database to review preferences and trends for our own internal statistical and analytical purposes, which we may use for marketing purposes and with respect to operations and development;
•	Confirm the accuracy of our data with the data held by third parties;
•	Prevent activity we determine to be potentially illegal, harmful or not in the public interest; and
•	Enforce this Privacy Policy and/or our Terms of Use.

## **DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA**
Although YouNow makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal data, in response to a subpoena, regulatory investigation or court order, to law enforcement authorities or regulators who have demonstrated their lawful authority. We may also disclose personal data for the public interest or in good faith to prevent harm to individuals. Keep in mind we also share personal data with trusted third parties in order to effectively provide our Services to users.

In addition to responding to law enforcement or regulator requests for personal data, YouNow will disclose personal data to report suspected illegal activity. For example, media files may be shared with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

We may also disclose personal data to enforce our policies or respond to claims that a broadcast or other content violates the right of others. In all cases, such information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

YouNow may also share your personal data:
•	With third parties performing services on our behalf that have agreed to keep such information confidential (for example, secure payment processing).
•	In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, YouNow users will be notified before any such business transaction occurs, and be given the opportunity to deactivate or terminate their account should they so choose to. The acquiring company will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy.

## **SECURING PERSONAL DATA**
YouNow has implemented critical physical, organizational and technical measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of the data we collect. We have also taken steps to avoid accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Services reduce the likelihood of a data security breach.

In addition, we recommend that you do your part in protecting yourself from unauthorized access to your account by ensuring no one else uses your computer or mobile device when you are logged in, by logging off from our Services when not in use and by keeping your passwords confidential.

Here are some examples of the data security controls in place at YouNow (this is not an exhaustive list):
-	The use of encryption when personal data is transferred to YouNow’s servers; 
-	Limited access to personal data by YouNow staff on a need-to-know basis, and the use of robust authentication processes (e.g. complex passwords or two-factor authentication);
-	The use of data centers with effective physical and logical data security controls, and the use of reputable third parties who have demonstrated security consciousness; and
-	Secure office premises and staff that are keenly aware of their data protection responsibilities. 

## **COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS**
A cookie will be used here to mean a Web cookie, being a small text file stored on your computer hard drive, or a token or “mobile cookie” placed in the YouNow app’s local storage, in order to tailor the environment based on the user’s preferences and track the user’s behavior. 

Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. You should be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of our Services may not function properly or permit access.YouNow uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below.

The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor.  The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors, the websites that referred them and the YouNow pages visited, what time of day they visited, etc.  We use this information to help improve our Services, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on the YouNow Website and App. We use Google Analytics and other third party analytics services for this purpose to capture page and screen views. You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our  Services by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB.

## **NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER THIRTEEN**
This Service is a general audience Service, which is neither designed nor intended to collect personal data from children who are under the age of thirteen (13). You may reside in a country where local laws fix the digital age of consent to be older than 13. You may only use YouNow if you have reached this age of consent, in accordance with applicable local laws. If you do not meet the digital age of consent of your country, you must immediately cease using our Services.

In order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and other data protection laws around the world aimed at protecting children, in accordance with our Terms of Use, **children under the age of thirteen (13) are not permitted to access or use our Services**, and children under the age of thirteen (13) should not provide any personal data to the Website or the App. We ask that parents supervise their children while online and/or using mobile devices.

YouNow wants to keep the personal data we store about you as accurate and complete as possible. We rely on the user to provide accurate information and we also have protocols in place to promote data integrity. 

The information that we collect from you is the same information that you have previously provided to Facebook®, Google+®, Twitter®, Instagram®, or relevant portions thereof. By updating the information in one of these social media accounts, you may be automatically updating the information in your YouNow account the next time that you log in. You can access and modify your YouNow account information directly by logging into YouNow and clicking the 'Gear Icon', as well as make any changes to any express consents that you may have given with respect to us contacting you for YouNow news or promotions. 

## **RETENTION AND STORAGE OF THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**
We will retain your information as long as you are an active YouNow user, to permit us to use it for the purposes that we have communicated in this Privacy Policy. YouNow has implemented retention schedules to avoid indefinitely storing personal data that has been collected indirectly (for example, about a YouNow user’s social connections).

Personal data this is no longer required for administrative or business purposes, and that does not need to be archived by YouNow, will be overwritten or scrambled such that it no longer identifies a YouNow user. Keep in mind however that third parties who store data on our behalf have their own retention rules.

If at any time in the future we plan to share personal data with more third parties, we will maintain GDPR compliance and a high standard of care for your personal data. Your continued use of our Services following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.
